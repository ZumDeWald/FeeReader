# Feed Reader Project

* This Feed Reader was created by Udacity for testing purposes. It includes the Jasmine testing framework to perform automated testing.

* The Feed Reader itself uses a Google API to fetch feeds and then displays them.

* Jasmine works to ensure the Reader will properly fetch, display, and change the content.
